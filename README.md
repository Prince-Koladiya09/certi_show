### üìù Project Overview

The Certificate Manager is a dynamic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to serve as a personal portfolio for your achievements. Instead of a static list, this tool provides a database-driven solution to keep your certifications organized. The front-end is built with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a great user experience with smooth animations and a responsive design. The back-end is handled by Supabase, a powerful and easy-to-use open-source Firebase alternative, which provides the database and APIs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
*   A code editor (like VS Code).
*   A free Supabase account.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/certificate-manager.git
cd certificate-manager
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Supabase Backend

1.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in.
    *   Create a new project. Save your **Database Password** somewhere safe.

2.  **Create the `certificates` Table:**
    *   In your Supabase project, navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
    *   Click **"New query"**.
    *   Copy and paste the following SQL script and click **"RUN"**. This script creates the table with the correct column names that match the JavaScript code.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE public.certificates (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
      "certificateName" TEXT,
      "issuingCompany" TEXT,
      "issueDate" DATE,
      "certificateField" TEXT,
      "certificateDetails" TEXT,
      "certificateLink" TEXT
    );
    ```
    *This is the most important step. Using this exact script ensures your column names match the JavaScript code.*

3.  **Get Your API Keys:**
    *   Go to **Project Settings** (the gear icon).
    *   Click on the **API** tab.
    *   Under **Project API Keys**, you will find your `URL` and your `anon` `public` key.

#### Step 3: Configure the JavaScript File

1.  Open the `script.js` file in your code editor.
2.  At the top of the file, replace the placeholder values with the credentials you copied from your Supabase project.

    ```javascript
    const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL'; // Paste your Project URL here
    const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'; // Paste your anon public key here
    ```

#### Step 4: Run the Application

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. That's it! Your Certificate Manager is now live and connected to your database.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # The main HTML file with the page structure.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css       # The CSS file for all styling and animations.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # The JavaScript file for application logic and Supabase integration.
```

### üë®‚Äçüíª Code Explanation

#### HTML (`index.html`)

The HTML is straightforward, containing the main structure for the app.
*   **`<header>`**: Contains the application title and the "Add Certificate" button.
*   **`<main id="certificate-list">`**: This is the container where JavaScript will dynamically inject the certificate cards.
*   **`<div id="certificateModal">`**: A hidden modal that appears when adding or editing a certificate. It contains the input form.
*   **`<script>` tags**: The Supabase client library and our main `script.js` file are included at the end of the `<body>`.

#### CSS (`style.css`)

The CSS uses modern features for a clean and maintainable stylesheet.
*   **CSS Variables (`:root`)**: All primary colors, fonts, and spacing are defined as variables for easy theming.
*   **Flexbox & Grid**: The header uses Flexbox for alignment, and the certificate list uses CSS Grid for a responsive, auto-filling card layout.
*   **Animations**: Subtle `transform` and `box-shadow` transitions provide a smooth user experience. The modal has a `fadeIn` animation, and the cards have a `fadeInUp` animation.
*   **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used to ensure the application looks great on all devices.

#### JavaScript (`script.js`)

This file contains all the client-side logic. It is organized into distinct functional sections.

1.  **Supabase Initialization**:
    *   The `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are used to create a client instance that connects our app to the Supabase backend.

2.  **Fetching Certificates (`getCertificates`)**:
    *   This `async` function uses `supabase.from('certificates').select('*')` to fetch all records.
    *   The data is ordered by date to show the newest certificates first.
    *   Once fetched, it calls `renderCertificates` to update the UI.

3.  **UI Rendering (`renderCertificates` & `createCertificateCard`)**:
    *   `renderCertificates` clears the current list and loops through the fetched data.
    *   `createCertificateCard` generates the HTML for a single certificate card, including a conditional check to only show the "View on GitHub" button if a link exists.

4.  **Modal Management**:
    *   `openModal` handles both "Add" and "Edit" modes. If an `id` is passed, it finds the existing certificate data and pre-fills the form for editing.
    *   Event listeners are set up for the "Add Certificate" button, the close button, and clicking outside the modal to close it.

5.  **Form Submission (Add/Update)**:
    *   An event listener on the form's `submit` event prevents the default page reload.
    *   It checks if there's an `id` in the hidden input field.
        *   If an `id` exists, it performs an `.update()` operation in Supabase.
        *   If not, it performs an `.insert()` operation.
    *   After the operation, it re-fetches all certificates to show the updated list and closes the modal.

6.  **Handling Edit and Delete**:
    *   A single event listener is attached to the parent `certificate-list` container (event delegation).
    *   It checks if the clicked element was an "Edit" or "Delete" button.
    *   **Edit**: Calls `openModal(id)` to populate the form with that certificate's data.
    *   **Delete**: Shows a confirmation dialog. If confirmed, it performs a `.delete()` operation in Supabase and re-fetches the data.
